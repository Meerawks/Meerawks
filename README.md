### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A solution-oriented developer, a thinker and a lifelong learner. I like development for the satisfaction it provides after you overcome a challenge and complete a project. Design ignites my passion, but backend logic fuels my problem-solving spirit. Always learning, always building! 

Currently Learning web development through 'The Odin Project'
Student of BS Software Engineering at FUSST
